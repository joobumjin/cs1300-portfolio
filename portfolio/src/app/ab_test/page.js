                    The first change I implemented was to reorder the list of available appointment slots. 
                    I thought that users would be most likely to select their appoints based on location and time, in that order.

                <p className="main">    
                    Consequently, I utilized the F-Scan pattern to establish a layout that could be navigated quickly.
                    I organized the appointments into blocks that highlighted the locations with easily legible headers, 
                        while still maintaining the date for each appointment to come right after the location during the F-Scan.

                    The button originally looked like this:

                <p className="main">
                    One of the first problems that I found with the buttons as given in Version A of the interface was in the low contrast between the text and the background color. 
                    I thought that this low contrast might really impede the legibility and usability of the interface.
                </p>

                <p className="main">
                    Additionally, I looked to make the button for actually scheduling an appointment to be more intuitive by using cues from semi-flat design. 
                    Thus, in Version B, the buttons will darken (to imitate sinking in like a pressed button) upon being hovered to communicate pressability.

                    To quantify and compare the change in user experience, I focused on three primary metrics.

                <p className="main">
                    To gather statistics for these different metrics, a script was embedded into the interfaces before test users were tasked with scheduling a pre-specified appointment. Test users were first given Version A, then Version B.

                <p className="main">
                    Statistical analysis tools were provided through scripts implemented in Google Sheets. The use and outputs of these scripts are relatively similar to popular statistical packages like Minitab.

                    01 â€“ Misclick Rate
                </h3>

                <p className="main">
                    Upon performing a Chi Square test on the ratio of users who misclcked / did not misclick for both Version A and Version B, 
                    I concluded that it could be said that Version B users had different misclick behavior than Version A users, as over half of Version A users misclicked, compared to 0 Version B users.
                </p>

                <p className="main">
                    I think that Version B users were less likely to misclick due to the improved ordering and separation of appointment slots which made it easier to find the correct button.

                    02 â€“ Time Spent on Booking
                </h3>

                <p className="main">
                    On first glance, it seemed like users spent roughly half as much time finding the correct appointment in Version B of the interface, as compared to Version A.
                </p>

                <p className="main">
                    Moreover, further analysis from a 1-sided T Test seemed to support that users, on average, likely spent less time booking an appointment on Version B as compared to Version A.
                </p>

                <p className="main">
                    I believe this may have been influenced by the improvements to the appointment-finding process. 
                        Additionally, the more intuitive button color changes on hover also may have helped users figure out how to interact with the buttons a little faster.

                    03 â€“ Time Until First Click
                </h3>

                <p className="main">
                    Again, casually examined, it looks like Version B users were, on average, faster to make their first click on a button when compared to Version A users. This was further supported by the statistical test.
                </p>

                <p className="main">
                    I argue that the improved button interaction affordance likely helped contribute to users being more confident in how to interact with any button on the page.
